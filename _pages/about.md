Hey there! I am Elias Bassani, a Ph.D. student at the University of Milano-Bicocca, Italy (advised by <a href="https://ikr3.disco.unimib.it/people/gabriella-pasi/">Prof. Gabriella Pasi</a>). I also work for a private company called <a href="https://www.consorzioc2t.it">C2T</a>, which is funding my Ph.D.

My research involves designing novel approaches based on Neural Networks for Personalized Information Retrieval.
I am also interested in methods to leverage unlabelled data to improve Information Retrieval systems.

I like building softwares to speed up research activities.
In this regard, I authored <a href="https://amenra.github.io/ranx/">ranx</a>, a Python library for ranking evaluation, comparison, and fusion, and I built <a href="https://amenra.github.io/ranxhub/">ranxhub</a> a sharing platform for pre-computed runs.

I published in major conferences and journals, such as SIGIR, CIKM, ECIR, and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/information-fusion">Information Fusion</a>. New articles are coming in the next few months.
